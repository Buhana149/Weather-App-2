Weather App with Freezed package

## Getting Started

A cross-platform weather application built using Flutter, following the principles of clean architecture and state management with the Provider package. The app integrates the Freezed package for generating immutable data models and leverages REST API calls to fetch real-time weather data. Key features include:

Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns through layers (data, domain, and presentation), ensuring maintainable and testable code.
State Management: Managed using the Provider package to handle application-wide state efficiently.
API Integration: Weather data fetched via REST API with models generated using the Freezed and json_serializable packages for JSON serialization and immutability.
User Interface: Displays real-time weather information, including current conditions, forecasts, and location-based weather suggestions.
Technologies: Flutter, Provider, Freezed, Clean Architecture, REST API, JSON serialization.
